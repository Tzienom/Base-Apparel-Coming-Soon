## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

At the cause of building this project, I did learn a few things like turning an anchor tag (<a>) into a button that submits a form, I was able to use JavaScript to switch layout positions of two elements. I did learn CSS animations, and had it implemented on this project, and quite a few others, too. In all, I loved building this.


### Continued development

- DOM Manipulation
- CSS animation


### Useful resources

- [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/css-animations/?ref=lbp](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/css-animations/?ref=lbp) - This was where I learnt CSS transform methods, and CSS animations, too.
